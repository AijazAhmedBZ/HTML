    <h1>Summary - Chapter 2</h1>
    <p>HTML uses elements to describe the structure of the page (e.g: headings, sub-headings, paragraphs</p>
    <p>Creating a page involves adding tags to the content. These tags are known as <q>markup.</q></p>
    <p>There are two types of markups.</p> i) Structural ii) Semantic.
    <p>Structural markup: The element that we can use to describe both headings and paragraphs</p>
    <p>Semantic markup: Which provides Semantic information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, when text
        is a quote (and who said it), or the definitionof an acron.</p>

        and leasrn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also
        introduces
        them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like web3 and Truffle and in-depth understanding of
        Blockchain-as-a-Service
        (Baas) and how to develop and offer an initial Coin offring (ICO) of a crypto-token.

    <h1>Summary - Chapter 4</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>To creat hyperlinks in HTML, we use anchor tags. < a>
                < /a>.</li>
        <li>The text between the opening < a> tag and the closing < /a> tag is called the link text.</li>
        <li>There are two basic choices when it comes to the selection of URLs.</li>
        <li>Absolute URL - Usually used to navigate to another website.</li>
        <li>Relative URL - Usually used to navigate within the same website.</li>
        <li>Anchor elements always carry an attribute called href (Hypertext Reference). The value of <br />
            the href attribute is the URL that you want people to go to when they click on the link text <br />
            (The value of the href attribute becomes the link).</li>
        <li>Either Relative or Absolut URLs may be used inside the href attribute.</li>
        <li>When linking to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full <br />
            web address for the website (including the domain name). This is the Absolute <br />
            URL.</li>
        <li>When you're linking to other pages within the same site, you can use Relative <br />
            URLs. Relative URLs are like a short-hand version of Absolut URLs because <br />
            there's NO NEED to specify the domain name.</li>
        <li>Relative URLs help when building a site on your computer because you can creat <br />
            links between pages without having to setup your domain name or hosting</li>
        <li>To open a link in a new browser window or tab, you can use the target attribute in the <br />
            opening < a> tag. The value of the target attribute should be "_blank".</li>
        <li>The default value of the target attribute is "_self", which means the link will be <br />
            opened in the current window or tab.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Three Rules to creating Images</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Save Images in the right format.</li>
        <li>Save Images at the right size.</li>
        <li>Use the correct resolution. it should be 72 pixels per inch</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Image Format</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>JPEG (Joint Photograghic Experts Group), is used for large numbe of colors.</li>
        <li>PNG and GIF is used for small number of colors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Image Resulotion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Imagees should be saved as 72 PPI i.e. 72 pixels per inch.</li>
        <li>JPEG, PNG and Gif belonges to bitmap Imagees, so thay are <br />
            resulotion dependent.</li>
        <li>Image resulotion comprises of number of squires and those are
            <be />
            fit in one inch by on inch squires are.
        </li>
        <li>Imagees in print materials (such as books and magazines) are made up <br />
            of tiny circles called dots. These imagees are usually printed at a resolution <br />
            of 300 dots per inch (dpi).</li>
        <li>Vector images/formate are line drawings and resolution independent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Summary - Chapter 5</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The < img> element is used to add images to a webpage. This is an empty element (which means there is no
                closing tag).</li>
        <li>The < img> element must carry the following two attributes: <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>src - Used to indicate the source of an image.</li>
                    <li>alt - Used to describe the content of an image.</li>
                </ul>
        <li>The text used in the alt attribute is referred to as "Alt Text". The Alt Text should provide an accurate
            description<br />
            of the image content so it may be understood accurately by screen reading software and search engines.</li>
        <li>
            < img> is an inline element.
        </li>
        <li>Images should be saved at the size you will be using them on the webpage and the format should be
            appropriate.</li>
        <li>Photographs are the best saved as JPEG.</li>
        <li>Illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIF's.</li>
        <li>To associate as < img> element with its caption, HTML5 has introduced a new < figure> element which<br />
                    can contain images and their captions so that the two are associated.</li>
        <li>To add a caption to an image, the < figcaption> element may be used. This element is contained inside the <
                    figure> element.</figure>

    <p class="course">
        The artificial Intelligence program of the PIAIC takes the students through the foundation of the AI technology,
        via teaching programing in open source languages like python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 & Flask and teaching
        deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h1>Cloud Native Computing</h1>
    <p class="course">
        The Cloudna Natiive Computing program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like Linux,
        Docker,
        Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.JS, React and react native while introducing students to development of
        Microservices
        and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h1>Blockchain Computing</h1>
    <p class="course">
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum and Hyperledger (fabric)
        and leasrn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also
        introduces
        them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like web3 and Truffle and in-depth understanding of
        Blockchain-as-a-Service
        (Baas) and how to develop and offer an initial Coin offring (ICO) of a crypto-token.
